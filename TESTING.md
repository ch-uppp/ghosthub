## Debugging Tips

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Look for `[GhostHub]` prefixed messages
   - Check for initialization messages
   - Verify image detection logs

2. **Verify Chrome AI APIs:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   await window.ai.languageModel.capabilities()
   ```

3. **Check Storage:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   chrome.storage.local.get(null, console.log)
   ```

4. **Inspect Elements:**
   - Check for `data-ghosthub-processed="true"` on images
   - Verify button injection in DOM
   - Check for style attribute with green border

5. **Network Tab:**
   - Monitor GitHub API calls
   - Check for image fetch requests
   - Verify authentication headers
