# GhostHub

**Turn chat chaos into GitHub issues â€” automatically, privately, instantly.**

GhostHub is a Chrome extension that listens to Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp Web messages, detects actionable developer messages (bugs, feature requests, PR mentions), and drafts structured GitHub issues â€” all locally and powered by Chromeâ€™s built-in AI APIs. Multimodal support lets GhostHub also read screenshots and code snippets.
